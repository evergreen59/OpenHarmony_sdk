# Device Management - Sensor

### Introduction

This sample uses the orientation sensor APIs to implement the compass effect.

### Usage

When you rotate your device, the compass pointer rotates with it. The rotation angle for true north is displayed in the lower part of the home screen of the sample app.

### Constraints

After opening the sample app, you need to make a figure 8 until the compass is calibrated.

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices. (Currently, only wagner is supported.)
