# Contact

### Introduction

This sample shows how to use the mobile phone contact function.

In this example, we'll use the [Tabs](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/reference/arkui-ts/ts-container-tabs.md) component to set the overall application layout, and use the [List](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/reference/arkui-ts/ts-container-list.md) component to set the page layout of the home page, and use the [AlphabetIndexer](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/reference/arkui-ts/ts-container-alphabet-indexer.md) component to set the index bar.

Usage

1. Touch **+** to go to the page for adding a contact. Enter the contact information, and then tap **âˆš** to confirm and return to the home page.

2. Touch the contact list to view the detailed contact information. You can also edit or delete the contact information as needed.

3. Enter a number or email address in the search box to search for a contact.
