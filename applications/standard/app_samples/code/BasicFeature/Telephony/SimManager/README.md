# SIM Management

## Introduction

This sample shows how to use the SIM management service to manage SIM settings, including the ICCID, default voice service, ISO country code, home PLMN, service provider name, and GID1.

### Usage

1. Check the SIM card area. If a SIM card is inserted into SIM card slot 1, the SIM card 1 area is displayed in blue; if no SIM card is inserted, the SIM card 1 area is displayed in white. The case is the same for SIM card 2 area.

2. Click the SIM card 1 area. A dialog showing the ICCID, ISO country code, home PLMN, service provider name, and GID1 of SIM card 1 will be displayed. If you click the SIM card 1 area again, the dialog disappears. The case is the same for SIM card 2 area.

3. Buttons for the default active SIM card are in blue background. Currently, only the default active SIM card is displayed. The function of changing the default active SIM card is not supported.

4. The call transfer function is not supported currently, and therefore the button is not responsive.

### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.
