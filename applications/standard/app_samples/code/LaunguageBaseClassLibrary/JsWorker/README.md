# JsWorker



### Introduction

This sample shows how to start a worker thread in JS and implement the communication between the worker thread and host thread.

### Usage

1. On the sample app, four strings are displayed on the home screen. After you touch **Sort string array**, these strings are sent to the worker thread. The worker thread sorts the strings and sends the result to the host thread. The host thread then displays the strings after sorting on the home screen.

2. You can touch **Clear** to clear the strings after sorting.



### Constraints

This sample can only be run on standard-system devices.
