### Introduction

Base64 is a method of representing binary data based on 64 printable characters. This sample shows Base64 encoding and decoding output.

### Usage

1. Touch **Encode**. The sample app converts the string into ASCII code, encodes the ASCII code, and displays the encoded result in the text box.

2. Touch **Decode**. The previously encoded result is used as the input to the decoder. After decoding, the sample app obtains an ASCII code array, converts it into a string, and displays the string in the text box.
