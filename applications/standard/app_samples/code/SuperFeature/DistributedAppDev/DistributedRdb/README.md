### Introduction

This sample shows how to add, delete, modify, query, and synchronize data in the distributed relational database with extended TypeScript (eTS).

### Usage

1. After starting the app, touch **+** to add a contact.

2. Touch a contact. On the edit page displayed, you can modify the contact information.

3. Touch and hold a contact. The **Select All**, **Cancel**, **Delete**, and **Quit** buttons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. You can touch **Quit** to quit the current page.

4. Touch the **More** button in the upper right corner, touch **Connect device**, and select the device with data to be synchronized. After the connection is set up, data is synchronized to the connected device.

5. Touch the **More** button in the upper right corner and touch **Settings**. On the page displayed, you can set the data synchronization mode, which can be **Automatic synchronization** or **Manual synchronization**.

### Constraints
