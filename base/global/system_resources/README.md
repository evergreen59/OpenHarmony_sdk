# Resources

## Introduction

The Resources module defines global resources at the system level.

### System Fonts

By default, the Resources module provides only one font family, namely, HarmonyOS Sans.

HarmonyOS Sans is a family of variable fonts developed by Huawei for all-scenario experience. It is available for commercial use for free. For details, see the license agreement.

The font family currently provides six font weights: Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and Black. You can select a proper font weight based on the information hierarchy.

It supports a total of 105 languages from the Chinese, Latin, Cyril, Greek, and Arabic language systems at present. More languages will be supported in the future.

### System Resource Package

The system resource package accommodates resources that are widely used by applications, such as the layered parameters, permission names and descriptions, etc. In addition, permission definitions are provided in the **config.json** file.
