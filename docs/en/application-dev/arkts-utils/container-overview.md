# Overview of Containers

The container classes provide a set of methods to process elements of various data types stored in containers.

The container classes are implemented in a way similar to static languages. By restricting storage locations and attributes, they remove redundant logic for each type of data while providing the complete functionalities, ensuring efficient data access and improving application performance.

Currently, OpenHarmony provides 14 types of linear and non-linear containers, each of which has its own features and uses cases. For details, see [Linear Containers](linear-container.md) and [Nonlinear Containers](nonlinear-container.md).
