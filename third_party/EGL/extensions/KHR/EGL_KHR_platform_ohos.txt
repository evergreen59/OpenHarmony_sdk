Number

    EGL Extension #149

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    EGL 1.5 is required.

Overview

    This extension defines how to create EGL resources from native Android
    resources using the EGL 1.5 platform functionality.

New Types

    None

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as the <platform> argument of eglGetPlatformDisplay:

        EGL_PLATFORM_OHOS_KHR                0x34E0

Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To determine if the EGL implementation supports this extension, clients
    should query the EGL_EXTENSIONS string of EGL_NO_DISPLAY.

    To obtain an EGLDisplay for the Openharmony device, call eglGetPlatformDisplay
    with <platform> set to EGL_PLATFORM_OHOS_KHR and with <native_display>
    set to EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY.

    For each EGLConfig that belongs to the Openharmony platform, the
    EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID attribute is an Openharmony window format, such as
    PIXEL_FMT_RGBA_8888.

    To obtain a rendering surface from an Openharmony surface window, call
    eglCreatePlatformWindowSurface with a <dpy> that belongs to the Openharmony
    platform and a <native_window> that points to a HNativeWindow.

    It is not valid to call eglCreatePlatformPixmapSurface with a <dpy> that
    belongs to the Openharmony platform. Any such call fails and generates
    an EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error.
