Number

    EGL Extension #148

Dependencies

    EGL 1.2 is required.

    EGL_KHR_image_base is required.

    This extension is written against the wording of the EGL 1.2
    Specification.

Overview

    This extension enables using a Openharmony native buffer (struct
    HNativeWindowBuffer) as an EGLImage source.

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <target> parameter of eglCreateImageKHR:

    EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS             0x34E1

Changes to Chapter 3 of the EGL 1.2 Specification (EGL Functions and Errors)

    Add to section 2.5.1 "EGLImage Specification" (as defined by the
    EGL_KHR_image_base specification), in the description of
    eglCreateImageKHR:

   "Values accepted for <target> are listed in Table aaa, below.

      +-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
      | <target>                | Notes                                             |
      +-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
      | EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS  | Used for Openharmony HNativeWindowBuffer objects  |
      +-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
       Table aaa.  Legal values for eglCreateImageKHR <target> parameter

    ...

    If <target> is EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS, <dpy> must be a valid display,
    <ctx> must be EGL_NO_CONTEXT, <buffer> must be a pointer to a valid
    HNativeWindowBuffer object (cast into the type EGLClientBuffer), and
    attributes other than EGL_IMAGE_PRESERVED_KHR are ignored."

    Add to the list of error conditions for eglCreateImageKHR:

      "* If <target> is EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS and <buffer> is not a
         pointer to a valid HNativeWindowBuffer, the error EGL_BAD_PARAMETER
         is generated.

       * If <target> is EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS and <ctx> is not
         EGL_NO_CONTEXT, the error EGL_BAD_CONTEXT is generated.

       * If <target> is EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_OHOS and <buffer> was created
         with properties (format, usage, dimensions, etc.) not supported by
         the EGL implementation, the error EGL_BAD_PARAMETER is generated."

Issues

    1. Should this extension define what combinations of HNativeWindowBuffer
    properties implementations are required to support?

    RESOLVED: No.

    The requirements have evolved over time and will continue to change with
    future Openharmony releases. The minimum requirements for a given Openharmony
    version should be documented by that version.
